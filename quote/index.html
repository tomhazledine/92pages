            <p>Never before have consumers been more comfortable with technology, and never before have so many businesses completely overlooked such a massive opportunity. At <span class="name92">92pages</span>, we aim to change this. We work with businesses to ensure the internet is an asset to their company.</p>

            <blockquote><p>Design is about more than just the visuals, and technology is about more than just adding complexity.</p></blockquote>

            <p>We see designing for the web as a kind of architecture; it defines how your customers move through your space, and how they feel as they do it. We see technology as an opportunity to make things simpler, not more complicated.</p>

            <p>At <span class="name92">92pages</span> we combine bespoke interaction design with cutting edge technological development. We make beautifully seamless experiences for your customers and staff.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="process">Our Process</h2>
            <a class="backToTop" href="#top">Back to top</a>

            <p>What <span class="name92">92pages</span> will <em>not</em> do is take a brief and then disappear for months, only returning for a Big Reveal&trade; at the end of the project. We take an agile approach to managing projects; dealing with <em>features</em> in short sprints, testing and reviewing, and then refining. Test, Measure, Learn.</p>

            <p>To be sure of delivering a successful end-product, we need to break the site down into sections. These sections should be deliverable features that can be built quickly and tested early.</p>
            <h3>A typical project may include the following example sections:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Initial Sprint: The minimum viable product (MVP)</h4>
                    <p>The MVP represents the smallest amount of work we can do to get something in front of test users. Typically this is a content-based website that conforms to the brand guidelines and conveys the appropriate tone of voice.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Feature Sprints</h4>
                    <p>Feature Sprints tackle specific areas of functionality. Need a blog, for instance? That's a Feature Sprint.</p>
                    <p>We'd then build the necessary functionality (in the case of a blog: the ability for a site owner to log-in and create/manage/delete content, and for a site user to access/browse/search that content). The sprint ends when that feature ships, which means we can get it in front of testers and a small cohort of real users.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>The power of a sprint-based approach is twofold:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>The client sees regular progress.</h4>

                    <p>You can be a regular collaborator in the project. This ensures we stay on track, and that you get the site you really want.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Testing happens sooner.</h4>
                    <p>User Experience issues are identified sooner, and can therefore be addressed more efficiently.</p>
                    <p>All devices can be tested from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Accessibility concerns are addressed throughout the process, not as an afterthought.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <blockquote><p>Sometimes needs change, or ideas &mdash; once tested &mdash; just don't work. Sometimes alternative options present themselves out of the ether&hellip; Regular reviewing of the project's objectives and progress keeps things moving in the right direction.</p></blockquote>

            <p>This allows us to get a working product in the hands of testers as early as possible. Catching issues early helps us stay on-budget and on-time. If we catch issues early, addressing them is much faster.</p>

                    <h4><a href="http://www.outbacktrading.co.uk">Outback Trading</a></h4>
                    <p>Outback Trading were your traditional bricks and mortar outdoor and camping shop based in Helston, Cornwall. In 2009 owners Richard and Debbie commissioned 92pages to develop their new e-commerce website. Our involvement started with consultancy, this allowed us to get a really good understanding of how the business works and who their customers are. This is the foundation for any successful project. We identified all the key goals to measure how successful the site is, one obvious goal is someone purchasing, and less obvious goals are customers sharing pages over social media.</p>
                    <p>We used our in-house e-commerce platform for the development, as we know it has the scalability and speed to out perform popular off the shelf alternatives.</p>
                    <p>In 2014 92pages were asked to redesign the website to make it mobile friendly. Outback Trading now have a responsive site with sales growing year on year.</p>
                    <p>This year Outback Trading are aiming to hit &pound;1.7million in online sales.</p>

                    <p>We have been working with Perfect Stays team for over 5 years. Their market is high-end holiday home bookings. This is a fast paced industry that needs constant updates to keep them ahead of their competitors. We have a proactive approach with Perfect Stays that allows us to put recommendations to their team on ways to get the competitive advantage. We work closely with their external Search Engine Optimization company with regards to site structure and keyword placement.</p>
                    <p>Perfect Stays went though a rebuild in 2014 to make the website responsive. As part of this process we migrated the website over to WordPress to give them a modern Content Management System.</p>
                    <p>In late 2014 Perfect Stays commissioned us to build a website for their new brand The Beach House Company. This is based upon the same style as Perfect Stays but is used to target a specific market.</p>
                    <p>Perfect Stays are seeing an increase in traffic month on month along with more property owners choosing to list their properties with Perfect Stays.</p>

                    <p>MyRJ is a Restorative Justice Case Management System that provides online secure commutations between multi agencies, such as the Police, Probation, Prison Service and local community groups.</p>
                    <p>92pages were asked to develop this secure case management system. Part of this process was getting to understand the variety of requirements from large Public Sector organizations, all of which have their own views on how things should work. One of the challenges was to take all these requirements and find the common ground to develop a system that fits the needs of all involved.</p>
                    <p>This is a one of its kind system that works using a secure Internet connection. The MyRJ was given the approval by the Ministry Of Justice for its level of security.</p>
                    <p>MyRJ now has the majority of UK Police forces utilizing its systems. In 2013 the business won the award for Best New Business.</p>

        <section id="hosting">
            <h2>Hosting & Maintenance</h2>
            <a class="backToTop" href="#top">Back to top</a>

            <p>It would be our recommendation to have the your new website hosted on it's own virtual dedicated server (VDS). The benefits of using a VDS are that you get your own server resources and don't share the space with other websites.</p>
            <blockquote><p>We use Linux based hosting as our websites are built using PHP and MySQL. The server will run the latest versions of PHP and MySQL that are compatible with WordPress.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Our servers are based in a secure data center in Slough, Berkshire. Our servers are supported 24x7 365 days a year.  We make daily backups of the database and files, so if anything did happen you're files are safe.</p>
            <p>As part of the server setup we configure a firewall for an extra layer of security. This is used to detect unauthorized access to the server. We also recommend adding an SSL (secure server certificate) to the whole server to encrypt any data that's sent over the server.</p>
            <p>We offer maintenance packages that range from monthly WordPress updates and audits through to content population and reviews. As a minimum we would suggest the monthly WordPress update, this will ensure your Content Management is secure and up to date.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="thirdParty">
            <h2>CMS &amp; Third Party</h2>
            <a class="backToTop" href="#top">Back to top</a>

            <p>It would be our recommendation to use <span class="name92">WordPress</span> for the Content Management System (CMS). WordPress is an industry leading open source CMS that provides the flexibility and speed required for the new Girl Guiding Scotland website.</p>
            <blockquote><p>WordPress is an open source CMS and there is no annual license fee, it's easy to learn for content editors and you're not tied to one development agency for future updates.</p></blockquote>
            <p>In the past WordPress has been seen as a blogging platform, and it still is. However it has evolved over the last couple of years to become one of the most powerful, versatile and used Content Management Systems available. It's large following means there are plenty of plugins out there that can be used to easily add functionality to a website. These include, event calendars, booking modules, galleries and even a social network.</p>
            <p>In your requirements you mention the different levels of access, this something that can be setup using the different roles within the admin area. An additional free plugin can be used to define extra roles such as only allowing the Chief Executive to see the job adverts.</p>
            <p>301 redirects are important not only to ensure the user is shown the right page they may have previously bookmarked but also from the Search Engine perspective to keep preserve and previous rankings. We can provide the facility to ensure these are mapped over. This process works by looking at the top indexed pages in Google and working with you to help identify the new alternative page. This is a process that is done once all the new content has been added.</p>
            <p>At this point it's hard to know what third party plugins will be required, however licensing needs to be considered for any fonts that are used. Subscription based services like fonts.com are available for a fee of around &pound;120 per year. You will be notified during the design presentation of any costs that are involved around fonts and images. If any stock images need to be purchased this will be at an additional cost.</p>

        <section id="grey">
            <h2>Grey Areas</h2>
            <a class="backToTop" href="#top">Back to top</a>
            
            <h3>Online Shop</h3>
            
            <p>It's hard to provide you with a detailed recommendation on the best route without fully understanding your e-commerce requirements and who your EPOS provider is.  Generally when we're quoting for e-commerce sites we look mainly on the back office and admin requirements as opposed to the front end and cart functions. If you're after a simple online shop then you could consider WooCommerce, this is a free WordPress plugin that works well for simple products. The back office functions are limited. Without knowing more about your EPOS system we can't confirm how well this will work.</p>
            <p>The other alternative is to look at something more bespoke. This will then be built around your business requirements that we'll establish at a later date. With this option your e-commerce solution will be outside of your WordPress build, but will integrate seamlessly.</p>
            <p>It would be our recommendation to look at WooCommerce as this keeps everything in one place. It's also the most cost effective option and timescales are more achievable.</p>

            <h3>Netherurd</h3>

            <p>A simple microsite can sit within the Girl Guiding Scotland website that is focused around Netherurd house. This can have it's own branding but follow the main website structure. The Netherurd House URL can point directly to the microsite.</p>

            <h3>Members Area</h3>

            <p>Setting up a secure members area can be done using a paid WordPress plugin. This will allow you to setup and define restricted content. Different user levels can be set depending on what content each user can see. Having the SSL installed will make the login process secure.</p>
            <p>The use of Office 365 is a good alternative if SharePoint is used, however the login process and user experience won't be as friendly as something integrated within the Girl Guiding Scotland website.</p>

            <h3>Donate Button</h3>

            <p>In your brief you mention using an external supplier for providing this service. From our previous experience donation providers provide a simple script to allow donations to be easily made. It would be our recommendation to have the donate button prominent on all the pages.</p>
            <p>With regards to the timescale, the signup to your donation provider should coincide with the contact being awarded. As part of the kick off meeting we'll then have a clear objective of how this needs to work.</p>
