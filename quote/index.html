            <p>Never before have consumers been more comfortable with technology, and never before have so many businesses completely overlooked such a massive opportunity. At 92pages, we aim to change this. We work with businesses to ensure the internet is an asset to their company.</p>

            <p>Design is about more than just the visuals, and technology is about more than just adding complexity. We see designing for the web as a kind of architecture; it defines how your customers move through your space, and how they feel as they do it. We see technology as an opportunity to make things simpler, not more complicated.</p>

            <p>At 92pages we combine bespoke interaction design with cutting edge technological development. We make beautifully seamless experiences for your customers and staff.</p>

            <p>What 92pages will <em>not</em> do is take a brief and then disappear for months, only returning for a “Big Reveal” at the end of the project. We take an agile approach to managing projects; dealing with <em>features</em> in short sprints, testing and reviewing, and then refining. Test, Measure, Learn.</p>

            <p>To be sure of delivering a successful end-product, we need to break the site down into sections. These sections should be deliverable features that can be built quickly and tested early.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>A typical project may include the following example sections:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Initial Sprint: The minimum viable product (MVP)
                    <ul>
                        <li>The MVP represents the smallest amount of work we can do to get something in front of test users. Typically this is a content-based website that conforms to the brand guidelines and conveys the appropriate tone of voice.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feature Sprints
                    <ul>
                        <li>Feature Sprints tackle specific areas of functionality. Need a blog, for instance? That's a Feature Sprint.</li>
                        <li>We'd then build the necessary functionality (in the case of a blog: the ability for a site owner to log-in and create/manage/delete content, and for a site user to access/browse/search that content). The sprint ends when that feature ships, which means we can get it in front of testers and a small cohort of real users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The power of a sprint-based approach is twofold:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>The client sees regular progress.</h4>
                    <p>You can be a regular collaborator in the project. This ensures we stay on track, and that you get the site you really want.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Testing happens sooner.</h4>
                    <p>User Experience issues are identified sooner, and can therefore be addressed more efficiently.</p>
                    <p>All devices can be tested from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Accessibility can</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sometimes needs change, or ideas – once tested – just don't work. Sometimes alternative options present themselves out of the ether... Regular</p>

            <p>This allows us to get a working product in the hands of testers as early as possible. Catching issues early helps us stay on-budget and on-time. If we catch issues early, addressing them is much faster.</p>
